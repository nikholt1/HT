## How To make a contribution

### open issues
You can find all the issues [here](https://github.com/users/nikholt1/projects/6) <br>
view the issues you find interesting, know something about or even if you want to help implement a new feature.

### 🍴Step 1: Fork
>Fork the repository by pressing _"Fork"_ next to the project repository.


### 🌲 Step 2: Branch
>Make a new branch that has the feature name and number from the issues board.

### 👨‍💻 Step 3: Work
>Make the changes, updates or feature implementation that you want.


### 🛹🫸 Step 4: Commit and push
>Make a commit to stage the files you have made or changed, and push them with a descriptive message

### 🟩 Step 5: Create pull request
> Pull request title should be in the form of <type>(<package>): <subject> as per commit messages. Remember, it's okay if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request ever is). The reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!

<strong>I would prefer</strong> if you wrote the name of the issue and perhaps the # number aswell, on the pull request aswell.
This way i can easily find and read the issue you have submitted or what you might have fixed.

* If a reviewer recommends any changes, you can make the changes and resubmit the pull request
